# Project Suspended
This project is suspended until I discover a use case that would be better met through a new app than through non-software solutions and/or existing tools. See also: https://github.com/WildlyMe/App/issues/8.

# Mission
How often do you find yourself working for hours, forgetting to eat, holding off going to the bathroom, and feeling terrible in your body? How about in conversations? Do you lose sight of your feelings as you listen? Or maybe you lose clarity on your intentions and what motivates you, days or weeks after journaling about your life.

The mission of the WildlyMe app is to empower us to be more connected with ourselves.
